Redux consists of several core concepts that work together to provide a predictable state management solution for JavaScript applications. The key components of Redux include:

1. **Store:**
   - The store is a single JavaScript object that represents the entire state of the application. It holds the current state and provides methods to dispatch actions, subscribe to state changes, and retrieve the current state. The store is created using the `createStore` function from the Redux library.

    ```javascript
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    ```

2. **Actions:**
   - Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or occurrences in the application. They contain a `type` property that describes the type of action being performed and additional payload data. Actions are created by action creators, which are functions that return action objects.

    ```javascript
    const increment = () => ({
      type: 'INCREMENT',
      payload: 1,
    });
    ```

3. **Reducers:**
   - Reducers are pure functions responsible for specifying how the application's state changes in response to actions. A reducer takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. It should not modify the existing state but instead create a new state object.

    ```javascript
    const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
          return state + action.payload;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
    ```

4. **Dispatch:**
   - The `dispatch` function is provided by the Redux store. It is used to dispatch actions to the store, triggering the state change process. When an action is dispatched, it is processed by the reducers, and the state is updated accordingly.

    ```javascript
    store.dispatch(increment());
    ```

5. **Selectors:**
   - Selectors are functions that retrieve specific pieces of data from the state. They help decouple the shape of the state from the components that use it, providing a way to access and derive data from the state in a more organized manner.

    ```javascript
    const selectCounter = (state) => state.counter;
    ```

6. **Middleware:**
   - Middleware provides a way to extend the functionality of Redux. It sits between the dispatching of an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Middleware can be used for tasks such as logging, handling asynchronous actions, or modifying actions before they reach the reducers.

    ```javascript
    import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';
    import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

    const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
    ```

7. **Subscribe:**
   - The `subscribe` method allows components to listen for changes to the state. It takes a callback function that is called whenever the state in the store is updated. This enables components to react to state changes and update their UI accordingly.

    ```javascript
    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      console.log('State updated:', store.getState());
    });

    // To stop listening to state changes
    unsubscribe();
    ```

These core components work together to create a predictable and manageable state management system. Actions trigger state changes, reducers specify how the state changes, and the store orchestrates the entire process. Additionally, middleware and selectors enhance the capabilities of Redux, providing a powerful solution for managing the state of JavaScript applications.
